** Livestock is enabling native and remote CPython runtime couplings to Grasshopper3d**
see [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Grasshopper3d](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/), [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/)

> Livestock is an opensource lightweight CPython package, linking IronPython in Rhino3d+Grasshopper3d and Revit+Dynamo to CPython. Originally created by Christian Kongsgaard and Kristoffer Negendahl. Livestock is allowing people *"to extend the scripting/coding capabilities beyond IronPython by tunneling into the CPython ecosystem with the ambition to make faster and more open building/site performance analysis tools for Civil and Environmental Engineering disciplines."*
