## Style Guide
We try to follow PEP8 and the Zen of Python as much as possible to make our code reader friendly.
We differ from PEP8 in that we allow 120 characters long lines. (PyCharm default)

## Pull Requests
We prefer shorter pull requests over longer (in terms of written lines of Python code). 
That makes it easier for us to review the pull request.

Please refer to your initial issue in the comments of the pull request.

## Tests
Make sure that your change includes some tests. The pull request should contain some, so your change does not not break 
previous code.
